# Description
# This is a simple Weather and Space News web application built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to search for any city and view its current weather details like temperature and wind speed. It also includes a news section where users can read the latest space related articles. The project uses free public APIs to fetch real time data and displays it in a clean and responsive interface. This project helped me practice working with APIs, handling asynchronous JavaScript, and dynamically updating the webpage using DOM manipulation.
